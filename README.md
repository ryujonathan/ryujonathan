Good day, I am @ryujonathan, a student fresh out of first year computer engineering at the University of Toronto.
I am currently working in an internship for Amazon Web Services as part of the Amazon Future Engineer Program.
This is where I keep my projects for now, but I'm interested as I go through my academic and career journey to expand this with more projects!

As for my coding skills, they're not particularly spectacular, with some console-line coding in C and Java. Trying to get C++ to the same level of proficiency now,
possibly more advanced stuff in Python later on.

Thanks for your time!
